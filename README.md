An ontology and knowledge base project for the domain of the For Honor universe

Ontology in the domain of the Ubisoft title [For Honor](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-GB/game/for-honor/). We assume that we are in this fictional universe and we ask about:

- the sorts of entities which exist
- the sorts of relations there are between them. 

We construct a knowledge base about a number of instances falling under the categories we introduce in order to represent knowledge about this domain. 

## Status 

This is a starting prototype for which we carried out:

- informal ontological analysis (or conceptual modelling) 
- supreficial knowledge acquisition based on available documentation and in-game content
- a first design of an ontology that could be encoded using the tool Protege and OWL. 

## Content of the repository 

- pictures of conceptual modelling on paper 
- initial OWL encoding covering the sub-categories of Person and the ascription of specific categories to a Faction (instance).

We used concepts derived from the foundational ontology BFO. 

## TODO 

- Weapons (we could create a database to record a number of relations) 
- Processes (generic actions and move-sets) 

## Open issue 

- Abilities and feats
